This CodeBook describes the variables and the transformations utilized in the run_analysis.R script.

First the files are downloaded and combined as per instruction 1:
train.subj, train.data, train.label, test.subj, test.data, test.label contains the downloaded files.
all.subj is the combination of train.subj and test.subj
all.label is the combination of train.label and test.label
all.data is the combination of train.data and test.data

Secondly, the mean and standard deviation indices are extracted from features:
features variable contains the downloaded features
and from that I extracted only the mean and std names and saved the indices in a variable called ind.feat.
then I subset these data from all.data and named it sub.data, which contains the 66 variables and 10299 observations.

Thirdly, I renamed some of the column names in the sub.data variable so that it is reader-friendly.
I've also imported the activity labels and saved it as activity.label variable, which is also renamed accordingly.
Then I created a new.label variable which matches the activity.label and all.label variables according to the coding scheme.

In the 4th step, I merged all the variable into a final.data variable which contains 68 variables and 10299 observations.

5th step:
I created a tidy_data variable which contains the splitted final.data into columns respectively and had the means
applied to them.
Finally, the tidy_data variable is written out to a text file called tidy_data.txt as the end product of this project.
