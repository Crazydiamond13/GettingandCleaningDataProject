In this repository, you will see a R script called run_analysis.R which contains the code to perform the 'cleaning' as described in the 5-step instructions:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables involved in further details.

The tidy_data.txt is the end result of the run_analysis.R script, and it is also uploaded for grading purposes.
