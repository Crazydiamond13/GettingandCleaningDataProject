In this repository, you will see a R script called run_analysis.R which contains the code to perform the 'cleaning' as described in the 5-step instructions.

The codebook.md describes the variables involved in further details.

The tidy_data.txt is the end result of the run_analysis.R script, and it is also uploaded for grading purposes.
